Hybrid and fully electric cars are awesome because they will help us
save the planet from burning through more dinosaur juice! But temperature of
the battery and the way of driving your car is very important in order
to have a long-lasting battery with which you can drive over a long range.
This Data Analyst Nanodegree Visualization Project shows how electric car
batteries State-of-Charge diminishes or increases and how the temperature of
such a battery develops during different driving situations. The visualization
was created with scrambled R&D data from a german car manufacturer and also
contains options to drill down into an explorative mode which will be used by
roughly 200 researchers in the field.

# Design

TODO:
* design choices
* include the initial sketch / ideas (or video)
* perhaps include an early version with the gradient lines
* include any changes to the visualization after collecting feedback

# Feedback

TODO:
* share with at least 3 other people (Fabian, Carl, Hamid??, Udacity Forum...)
* include different versions of the visualization (at minimum: initial & final)
* include all feedback you received from first sketch to the final visualization
* Carls feedback: Change introductory sentence - it is not clear what is ment
  with "performance" of batteries
  * From: "Hybrid and fully electric cars are awesome because they will help us
    save the planet from burning through more dinosaur juice! But temperature of
    the battery and the way of driving your car can influence the
    batteries performance"

# Why This Project is Different

TODO:
* Explain while I "bended" the requirements a little and added my own touch

# Technical Documentation

TODO:
* Reference to TBD Whitepaper you should read before reading JSDoc /
  code comments:
  * Directory Structure
  * Terminology
  * JSON structure of data files
  * Components of the Application
  * Interaction of the Components ("highlights" object, "looseness", broadcasts)
  * JSDoc
